# Architecture

## Data flow

1. **Goals** become **tasks** with time and energy requirements.
2. The **scheduler** plans blocks based on constraints and your focus windows.
3. The **feedback loop** ingests signals from writing analysis, sensors, and self-reports.
4. The **agent pipeline** updates priorities, suggests practice, and logs learning.
